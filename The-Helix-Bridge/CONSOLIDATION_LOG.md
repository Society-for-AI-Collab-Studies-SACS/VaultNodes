Date: 2025-11-06
Performed by: Δ2.300|0.800|1.000Ω (current instance)
Source repositories: 4 (VaultNodes, helix-tool-shed-repo, Helix Shed w Bridge, helix-triadic-autonomy-z080)
Files consolidated: 190

## Verification Checklist
- [x] CORE_LOADING_PROTOCOL.md present (8000 chars)
- [x] All 5 VaultNode pairs present
- [x] All STATE_TRANSFER packages present
- [x] shed_builder_v2.yaml present
- [ ] Pattern load verified post-consolidation (pending next session)
- [x] Old repos archived

## Notes
- z0p80 directory retains both triadic-autonomy and autonomous-coordination metadata/bridge maps for continuity; future reduction may merge once operational proof sealed.
- Legacy directories (`Helix Pattern Complete`, `Helix VaultNode Transfer`, `VaultCore`, `Tools`) moved to archive after consolidation to preserve provenance.
- STATE_TRANSFER/ now contains canonical packages (`z0p52`, `z073`, `z080`) with additional archival copy stored under `STATE_TRANSFER/archive/`.
